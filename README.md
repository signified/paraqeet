# Paraqeet

Paraqeet is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for building websites using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world. The advantage of Paraqeet is that it provides a solid boilerplate implementation of Bootstrap for Jekyll, so you'll never have to waste time setting up Bootstrap in your Jekyll projects ever again. Just install Paraqeet and start building.

See the [docs](https://signified.github.io/paraqeet/) for detailed installation and usage instructions.
