# Paraqeet

Paraqeet is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme for building websites using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world. The advantage of Paraqeet is that it provides a solid boilerplate implementation of Bootstrap for Jekyll, so you'll never have to waste time setting up Bootstrap in your Jekyll projects ever again. Just install Paraqeet and start building.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "paraqeet"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: paraqeet
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install paraqeet
```

## Usage

Paraqeet is intended to be used as a basis for highly customised websites using Bootstrap. Like any Jekyll theme, Paraqeet ships with a base set of [`_includes`](https://github.com/signified/paraqeet/tree/main/_includes), [`_layouts`](https://github.com/signified/paraqeet/tree/main/_layouts), [`_sass`](https://github.com/signified/paraqeet/tree/main/_sass) and [`assets`](https://github.com/signified/paraqeet/tree/main/assets), which can be used, overridden or disabled as required.

Paraqeet ships with three main parts:

1. [Bootstrap](#bootstrap)
1. [Bootstrap Icons](#bootstrap-icons)
1. [Highlight](#highlight)

### Bootstrap

The core of Paraqueet is Bootstrap - the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS library in the world.

### Bootstrap Icons

Paraqeet ships with Bootstrap Icons - the official open source SVG icon library for Bootstrap.

### Highlight

Paraqeet supports syntax highlighting out of the box by providing the full set of [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) and [Pygments](https://pygments.org/) themes for Jekyll's built-in [code snippet highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#code-snippet-highlighting).
